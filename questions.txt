Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do? 
I expect it to open up python 
Now right click on the window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 
It added another line that described a place in the computer (assuming where my answer was saved?).
What do you think the program did with what you typed?
I think the program saved my answer - green - as an output in relation to the input, or the question.


Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 
It has a new factor called color
What do you think the color = input() will do? 
if color = input() then when color is printed what is in the input - what is your favorite color? will be printed
Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?



Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 
it has an if/else function
What is happening on lines 11–14? 
there is an if/else function
Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 
lines 12 and 14 are a result of lines 11 and 13, respectively, so they are indented
Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 

What does this tell you about "color"?



Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 
It is different because of the if/else function, but has two different inputs to get the if output
What problem is this trying to solve? 
its trying to give the right answer as red regardless of whether or not the user capitalizes the r in red
Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?



Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 

What problem is it trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?



Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?



Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 

What is the purpose of line 11? 

Run the program and answer the question.



Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.



Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 

What is the purpose of “count”? 

What is happening on line 22? 

Run the program.
